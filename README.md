# Log::ZMQ

## SYNOPSIS

Log::ZMQ is a Perl6 Logger that used zeromq to log over tcp/ip

## Introduction

The looging is decoupled in a client server architecture. The client sends
log meesages from the application to a LogCatcher listening on a tcp port.

The backend uses a publisher-subscriber pattern, which is suitable for
debugging asynchronous apps (by sheer luck, the purpose of writing it)
but not much else. A more general framework would require changing the pattern.

The frontend is designed to be spartan. Apart from the actual calls to the logging
api, setup is minimal: A single application-wide call to Logging::instance with
arguments, and an additional no-parameters call for each additinal place in the
code that wants to hold its own logger. Enumerated arguments can be entered with
colon notation, avoiding quotes, and it is possible to set defaults and log
with no extra arguments. A global .set-supress-level( :level)  can turn all
logging off. When silenced, log calls incur only the cost of argument checking (to
reduce the risk of logging itself introducing errors.)

The logging format is a choice of json, yaml and a raw format based on ZMQ frames,
and it can be extended on both sides with user-provided functions. On the backend,
there is currently no distinction between adding parsers and adding handlers. That
is also also a current limitation. The built-in parsers-handelrs all write the logged
message in multiline to STDOUT (again, useful for debugging, not so
much for motinoring. )

#### Status

In development. This is my learning process of perl6 and ZMQ. I have a lot to learn so use with care.


#### Portability
  depends on Net::ZMQ:auth('github:gabrielash');

## Example Code

#### A (minimal)
    my $l = Logging::instance( 'example' ).logger;
    $l.log( 'an important message');

    my $l2 = Logging::instance.logger;
    $l2.log( 'another important message');

#### B ( more elaborate )
    my $logger = Logging::instance('example', 'tcp://78.78.1.7:3301')\
                                , :default-level( :warning )\
                                , :domain-list( < database engine front-end nativecall > )\
                                , :format( :json ))\
                          .logger;      

    $logger.log( 'a very important message', :critical, :front-end );

    my $db-logger = Logging::instance.logger.domain( :database );
    $db-logger.log( 'meh');

#### C (the log catcher on the other side )
    # on the command line:
    ./log-catcher.pl --uri 'tcp://78.78.1.7:3301' --prefix example \
                        	       --format json --level debug database front-end

## Documentation

#### Log::ZMQ::Logging

  The logging framework based on ZMQ. Usually a singleton summoned with

    my $log-system = Logging::instance('prefix', ['tcp://127.127.8.17:8022', ... ]) ;
        ;  only supply parameters the first time

    The default uri is 'tcp://127.0.0.1:3999'

    Attributes
    prefix;   required
    default-level; (default = info)
    format;   default yaml
    domain-list; default ('--')            ;if left blank no domain is required below

  Methods
    logger()  ; returns a Logger
    set-supress-level(:level)               ;silences logging globally
    unset-supress-level()
    add-formatter()                         ;see below
    set-format()                            ;must use this after adding a formatter


#### Log::ZMQ::Logger

The logger

    Methods
      log( log-message, :level, :domain )
        ; level is optional.
        ; domain is optional only if a domain list is not set


The logging uses a publisher socket. All protocols send 5 frames
  1. prefix
  2. domain
  3. level
  4. format [ zmq | yaml | json | ... ]
  5. empty frame

followed with frames that depend on the format.
For zmq:
  6. content
  7. timestamp
  8. target

for yaml/json:
  6. yaml/json formatted  

To add custom formatter, use instance.add-formatter.  
  :(MsgBuilder :builder, :prefix, :timestamp, :level, :domain,  :content
                        --> MsgBuilder ) {
  ... your code here ...
  return $builder;
  }
    the builder should be returned unfinalized.
  then set the format:
    set-format('name');

#### Log::ZMQ::catcher

handles the logging backend, listening to zmq messages.

The wrapper script log-catcher.pl can be invoked from the cli. to see options:
    log-catcher.pl --help

This is the body of the MAIN sub

    my $c = $uri.defined ?? LogCatcher::instance(:$uri, :debug )
                          !! LogCatcher::instance( :$debug );
    $c.set-level-filter( $level);
    $c.set-domains-filter(| @domains) if @domains;
    $c.run($prefix);

current implemention print the received messaged to stdin. other backends can be added
with the following methods:

  * add-zmq-handler( &f:(:$content, :$timestamp, :$level, :$domain, :$target) )
  * add-handler( Str $format,  &f:(Str:D $content) )
